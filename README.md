# Problem Set 4.5

This problem set is a little unusual because it's only dealing with `this` and it's only got short answers. `this` is a complicated technical topic, and distilling complex topics down is a crucial coding skill.

Answer each of these questions as fully, yet simply, as you can. If you find your answers are clunky, re-write them. A few short answers are really code snippets, but there are no tests. It's up to you to verify what you code is correct.

Good luck!
